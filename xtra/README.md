# Overlay Project, xtra directory

The directory is labeled `xtra` as "extra" in English minus the 'e'. The pronounciation of the letter 'x' in English already contains the sound "ex" in "extra". 

This is where I should only put extraneous stuff that impacts this project.

2024 12 30, To start is the [heartbeat illustration / transform example](heartbeat-illustration.html), which has a somewhat centered `<div>` with a red heart-shape that bounces by doing `transform: scale(x);` in CSS where `x` is a number (integer or decimal). I suggest Mozilla Developer Network as the best place to pick up the most important details and examples to know about most HTML / CSS / JavaScript and other web-related, baseline technology.
